This workshop invites HCI researchers, UI designers, and practitioners to explore how integrating these models can lead to smarter, more responsive interfaces. Through expert talks, case studies, and hands-on collaborative sessions, participants will discuss how combining physical and mental user models can enhance interaction design in real-world contexts. Key topics include the influence of physical constraints on cognitive load in complex interfaces, the role of cognitive processes in optimizing motor performance, and how integrating these models can drive innovations in responsive, adaptive, and ergonomic design for interfaces such as wearables, VR/AR systems, and touch-based devices.


# Location and schedule
The workshop (W11) will take place on XX May 2025, 9:00–16:00 in **room XX**. See full CHI workshop programme [here](https://chi2025.acm.org/for-authors/workshops/).
