Computational models of how users perceive, think, and move in virtual or physical environments hold great promise for the future of HCI. Cognitive models help us understand how attention, beliefs, and goals shape user decisions, while biomechanical simulations capture the physical aspects of interaction—such as effort, fatigue, and posture.

The next frontier is connecting these two perspectives. By integrating cognitive and biomechanical modeling, we can create embodied user simulations that better predict user strategies, movements, and intent. This opens up new possibilities for benchmarking interaction techniques, optimizing ergonomics, and designing adaptive, user-aware systems.

This UIST workshop brings together researchers across disciplines to explore how computational modeling can enhance UI/UX design, automate system evaluation, and support personalization. Join us as we identify challenges, share ideas, and shape the future of interactive behavior simulation.

Submissions need not be at the intersection of the two fields; rather, we ask participants to detail their use &#40;or intended use&#41; of cognitive and/or biomechanical models in experience reports or position papers. Submissions should outline concrete applications, highlighting the difficulties and benefits of current approaches.)

# Goals and Activities 
The goal of Mind & Motion is to explore how cognitive and biomechanical models can advance user interface design and usability. By bringing together researchers and practitioners from across disciplines, the workshop aims to foster collaboration, share insights, and identify real-world applications where predictive and embodied user models can make a tangible impact in HCI.

We welcome anyone working on simulations or computational models of user behavior—whether focused on cognition, motor control, or their intersection. Participants are encouraged to share hands-on examples of their recent work, including prototypes, tools, or lessons from failed attempts. Our aim is to build a shared understanding of current challenges and opportunities in modeling interactive user behavior.

The workshop includes **two keynotes on cutting-edge research** in biomechanical simulations and cognitive modelling. After the  keynotes, which intentionally follow each other to provide input from different areas and perspectives, we foster discussions and exchange in small groups.

# Schedule and Location
The workshop will take place on XX May 2025, 9:00–17:00 in **room XX**. See full UIST workshop programme [here](https://uist.acm.org/2025/).
