The primary goal of **Mind & Motion** is to deepen the HCI community’s understanding of how biomechanical and cognitive models can be applied to enhance user interface design and usability. In addition to facilitating knowledge-sharing and inspiring new collaborations across disciplines, this workshop aims to identify practical applications where biomechanical and cognitive models can drive significant improvements in HCI.
Through the submitted position papers, keynotes, and group discussions, we aim to surface real-world use cases that demonstrate the potential "bang for the buck" of different types and combination of user models.

# Submissions

We invite submissions from researchers and practitioners interested in using models that integrate both biomechanics and cognition. Submissions need not be at the intersection of the two fields; rather, we ask participants to detail their use (or intended use) of cognitive and/or biomechanical models in experience reports or position papers. Submissions should outline concrete applications, highlighting the difficulties and benefits of current approaches.


## Submission Instructions

Submissions should be 2-4 pages (excluding references), following the single-column [ACM Master Article template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) and [SIGCHI accessibility guidelines](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/accessibility/).

## Reviewing and Publication Process

Workshop organizers will evaluate the submissions based on relevance and potential for stimulating discussion. Accepted submissions will be used as a basis for forming balanced discussion groups and guide workshop debates. Papers will be published on the workshop website and included in the workshop proceedings.

## Key Dates

**Submission Deadline:** February 13, 2025 (AoE)

**Notifications:** March 3, 2025 (AoE)

# Schedule and Location
The workshop will take place on XX May 2025, 9:00–17:00 in **room XX**. See full CHI workshop programme [here](https://chi2025.acm.org/for-authors/workshops/).
